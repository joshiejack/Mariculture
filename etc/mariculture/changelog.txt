==== BETA Notes ====
• This is purely for helping me test, I would like to see as many bugs reported as possible except the ones listed here.
• MAJOR: You need to install 'Enchiridion' if you want to keep my books, it's been split to a seperate mod for 'reasons'.
• Custom fluids/recipes for 1.7 with regards to crucible furnace aren't implemented yet, I plan to have all recipes for each machine to be customisable so that's off for now
• Plugins for mods, like tinkers and BOP are not implemented yet
• The screwed up rendering of void bottles is known, and is on the to do list
• Currently disabling the Fishery module can have dire consequences due to the vanilla fishing override, will sort this out later
• The Vanilla Overriding for fish and fishing rods isn't working correctly
• Some of the biomes that I should be overwriting aren't being, due to not giving proper names
• There is a crash when you wear scuba/diving gear underwater
• There's a startup error in the console, about failing to extend enchantment maximum
• Jewelry Enchanting has changed, the book has not yet been updated
• Please do as much testing as possible and report all bugs/quirks etc. on my github at: https://github.com/joshiejack/Mariculture/issues?state=open

==== Other ====
• Added Fluid Dictionary (Disabled by default, as it can be a bit exploitive xp wise, if not used correctly)
• Damaging jewelry will now not apply the damage to every item, but split it out across the items(if it's doing more than one damage), otherwise rings will die first, then bracelets, then necklaces.
• Mirrors are now required to take jewelry off, you don't need them to put them on, the controls to take off were fiddly anyways. (You can still swap existing pieces though).
• Jewelry is no longer damaged when the player is in creative
• Sonic the Hedgehog buffed to provide 1 minute per damage
• Shift + Right Clicking Custom blocks, now copies the texture as with others, simply shift + right click the paintbrush on NO blocks to set it to air now
• Removed Timelord, Focus Punch, Poison Ivy and Inferno Enchants
• Added Elemental Affinity Enchantment - Each pearl colour has a different effect with this enchantment, has negative affects on stuff other than pearls
• Ender Fish and Netherfish are no longer FORCED to live in the nether/end biomes. Now as long as the environment is correct, they will be happy.
• Blink distance per level increased to 16 blocks, you no longer need to be above a certain level to use it any time
• Air Pumps will now only 'work' when they receive power, they will only extract fluid at that point too
• FLUDD is now simply the activate key to activate, and shift + activate. Hover will 'hover' at the same height as long as you are pressing forward and activate, you will ascend normally, and holding space makes you ascend faster. Squirt mode no longer breaks blocks but does a lot more damage to entities, and you only occurs in short bursts.
• Pressure Vessels will no longer tick/auto-output, you'll need to use pipes from other mods or the sluice to extract liquids in to your machines, it now instafills fludds
• Kelp and Coral come in two forms, static and growable, what you find in the wild will always be static. In order to get ones that grow, kelp you craft with itself for seeds, and coral you soak in one tenth of a bucket of water in a vat.
